# Task Manager Application Documentation

## Overview

The Task Manager Application is a simple command-line tool designed to help users manage their tasks efficiently. It allows users to create, edit, and delete tasks, as well as view a list of existing tasks.

The application is built using Python and follows the MVC (Model-View-Controller) architectural pattern. It consists of three main components:

1. **Model**: Responsible for managing the application's data, including tasks and their details.
2. **View**: Provides the user interface for interacting with the application. In this case, it's a simple command-line interface.
3. **Controller**: Acts as an intermediary between the model and view, handling user input and updating the model accordingly.
